        This inspection report is the intellectual property of HDMK Home Inspection and is
        intended for the exclusive use of the client for whom it was prepared. It is not to be copied or disseminated to
        any other party without the expressed written consent of HDMK Home Inspection. Neither the inspector nor HDMK
        Home Inspection company shall have any liability whatsoever to any third party using or relying on its contents.
        Any third party using this report agrees thereby to defend, indemnify and hold the inspector and HDMK Home
        Inspection company harmless from any claims of any person relying on the report. This inspection report also
        includes a copy of the Building Inspection Authorization and Agreement.
        <br /> <br />
        HDMK Home Inspection and HDMK are registered trademarks of HDMK Franchising LLC. The HDMK logo encompasses two
        separately owned and operated companies (HDMK Home Inspection and HDMK Pest control LLC) and may be used by
        either of these companies. HDMK Home Inspection refers to an independently operated franchise. This report
        (and/or documents accompanying it) may contain privileged communications and confidential business information
        that is intended for use only by the individual or company to whom it is addressed. Disclosure, interception,
        copying or any other use of this report by anyone other than any intended recipient is prohibited. Any party
        using this report agrees thereby to defend, indemnify and hold the parent HDMK Home Inspection company, HDMK
        Pest control, HDMK, or HDMK Franchising LLC harmless from any claims of any person relying on the report.
        <br /> <br />
        This report is intended only as a general guide to help the client(s) make their own evaluation of the overall
        condition of the building, and is not intended to reflect the value of the premises, nor make any representation
        as to the advisability of purchase. The report expresses the personal opinions of the inspector, based upon his
        visual impressions of the conditions that existed at the time of the inspection only. The inspection process
        includes a limited, visual, performance based inspection of the property, subject to the limitations described
        herein and in the attached "Building Inspection Authorization and Agreement." The inspection and report are not
        intended to be technically exhaustive, or to imply that every component was inspected, or that every possible
        defect was discovered. It is recommended that proper installation of any equipment on the property be verified
        by consulting the manufacturer's instructions. While the inspector may mention an item that is suspected of
        being involved in a recall, every item in the home is not checked for recall status by the inspector. It is
        recommended that all devices in the home be checked for recalls at www.CPSC.gov. No disassembly of equipment,
        opening of walls, moving of furniture or floor coverings, appliances or stored items, or excavation was
        performed. All components and conditions which by the nature of their location are concealed, camouflaged or
        difficult to inspect are excluded from the report. If some areas are concealed by furniture or other personal
        property, it is highly recommended that the purchaser do a thorough inspection during their final walk through.
        If any problems or questionable conditions are reported on by the inspector, or if the purchaser is concerned
        with any property conditions, it is recommended that a qualified professional be retained to further investigate
        the situation, and make necessary upgrades as needed before the act of sale occurs.
        <br /> <br />
        Systems and conditions which are not within the normal scope of the building inspection (unless previously
        contracted) include, but are not limited to: formaldehyde, lead paint, asbestos, radon, carbon monoxide, fuel
        gas leaks, toxic or flammable materials, mold, contaminated drywall, carcinogens, or other environmental
        hazards, whether in the building, soil, water or air; pest infestation; playground equipment; efficiency
        measurement of insulation or heating and cooling equipment; internal or underground drainage or plumbing;
        sprinkler systems; pool and spa equipment; any systems which are shut down or otherwise secured; water wells
        (water quality and quantity); septic systems; zoning ordinances; intercoms; security systems; heat sensors;
        cosmetics or building code conformity. Any general comments about these systems and conditions are informational
        only and do not represent an inspection. If any potential problem is suspected regarding the above systems or
        conditions, it is recommended that a qualified professional be retained to further investigate the situation,
        and make necessary upgrades as needed before the act of sale occurs.
        <br /> <br />
        The inspection report should not be construed as a compliance inspection of any governmental or non governmental
        codes or regulations. The report is not intended to be a warranty or guarantee of the present or future adequacy
        or performance of the structure, its systems, or their component parts. This report does not constitute any
        express or implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for use regarding the condition of the property and it
        should not be relied upon as such. Any opinions herein expressed regarding adequacy, capacity, or expected life
        of components are general estimates based on information about similar components and occasional wide variations
        are to be expected between such estimates and actual experience.
        <br /> <br />
        We certify that our inspectors have no interest, present or contemplated, in this property or its improvement
        and no involvement with tradespeople or benefits derived from any sales or improvements. To the best of our
        knowledge and belief, all statements and information in this report are true and correct.
        <br /> <br />
        Should any disagreement or dispute arise as a result of this inspection or report, it shall be decided by
        arbitration and shall be submitted for binding, non-appealable arbitration in accordance with applicable laws
        and regulations of the State in which the inspection was performed, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.
        In the event of a claim, the Client will allow the Inspection Company to inspect the claim prior to any repairs
        or waive the right to make the claim. Client agrees not to disturb or repair or have repaired anything which may
        constitute evidence relating to the complaint, except in the case of an emergency.
        <br /> <br />
        This report includes an estimation of the age of the principal structure, some components, and its roof. This
        estimation is based on information provided to the inspector by the seller, purchaser, real estate agent, or
        property disclosure report, and is only an approximation.
        <br /> <br />
        Items inspected for this report are deemed "appears serviceable" if, at the time of inspection, they are
        considered to be in a functional and operable condition. These items may be at any point in their service life,
        from brand new to approaching end of life expectancy. As they are mechanical systems, it should be expected that
        they will, at some point, break down and need repair or replacement. This report is not intended to predict
        these events, it is simply an overview of the functionality of the items and systems inspected as they existed
        at the time of inspection. If there are any concerns about the life expectancy of any items in this report, it
        is recommended that additional evaluation by qualified licensed contractors be performed prior to closing.
        <br /> <br />
        The name of the inspector, contact information, and license number at the top of each page of the report shall
        be considered a suitable substitute for the inspectors hand written signature on the report.
